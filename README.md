## griffineng private repo for training
I'm a new Hubber that started at GitHub on Jan 25th, 2022. I've joined the Digital Customer Success team as a SPM (Senior Program Manager) and this role will be my first time using GitHub :octocat:. I'm excited to get started and drinking from the firehose at the moment and am really amused by the prevalence of emojis everywhere!

Previous stops in my working career include:
- Amazon (launch and product experience program management roles for Amazon Devices)
- Nordstrom (program management driving roadmap for data engineering team serving internal Nordstrom marketing/product/loyalty/finance teams)
- Expedia (pricing analytics and revenue/margin optimization for AMER/EMEA package, lodging and air products)

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my wife Nguyen and our yorkie-poodle dog named Oliver ðŸ¦®. I try to find myself going to the gym 4-5 times a week or substituting a Peloton ride when that isn't possible. We enjoy food (mostly of the Asian variety as noodles are life!) and when we travel, we seek out acclaimed restaurants or food experiences on top of museums, people watching, and sometimes random adventures. Our favorite trip was a 3 week jaunt through Europe after we got married that included a sailing day in Santorini, an awe-inspiring visit to the Parthenon and Vatican and incredible food (and a burning hole in my wallet) in London. 

My favorite city outside of my hometown of Seattle is Tokyo, JapanðŸ—¼. I fell in love with it during my first visit and have gone back several times. The city is massive with so many interesting places to explore including food (!). I've also come to appreciate the friendliness/politeness of Japanese citizens and how clean, efficient and accessible their public spaces are - super thoughtful and definitely a service/community oriented culture.

Hobbies include watching sports (Seattle teams like Seahawks, University of Washington Huskies), eating food ðŸ˜†, planning/going on travel adventures, spending time with friends/family, Star Wars, Marvel, credit card churning, video games ðŸŽ®, photography ðŸ“·, and I'm a fairly avid reader of news/current events and probably spend too much time on Reddit.

I look forward to working with the team - they've been welcoming and friendly which is so refreshing and encouraging! I tend to be more of a listener and may not always speak up but I hope to absorb and contribute in meaningful ways soon. I've been told I generally display a calm demeanor so please don't take that as a lack of care - I'm slightly introverted by nature by try to be thoughtful and empathetic in all my interactions ðŸ˜…
